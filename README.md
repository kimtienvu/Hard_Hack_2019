The theme was Public Utilities

## Smart Street
The problem my group and I tried to address is the issue of utility and public safety. Our project involved simulating street lights that would turn off whenever a person, car, or bicycle reaches a certain distance near the street light. The street lights would use sonar to detect whether a person, car, or bicycle is moving and the distance of the moving object from the street light determines the time the street lights will turn on and remain on before turning off, therefore saving electricity. There is also an emergency button that, when pressed, will set off an alarm, which addresses public safety.
